# Reinforcement Learning in imperfect informtion games

This project was based on the code from repository: https://github.com/lifrordi/DeepStack-Leduc

The module implemented in order to extract the features and train the neural network are:

- tree_data_generation
- strategy_net_builder
- strategy_net_trainer
- StrategyCriterion

The modules that compute the results are:

- tree_cfr2
- tree_values
- tree_warm_start
- exploitabilityVS

The notebooks to make the graphs:

- Experiments_Loss_functions
- Experiments_Exploitability
- Experiments_Poker_Match
- Experiments_warm_start
